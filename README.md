# FEC Filing Agent Skill

An [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) for analyzing Federal Election Commission (FEC) campaign finance filings.

This skill enables AI agents to fetch, parse, and analyze FEC filings directly within agent sessions. Parsing and filtering happen outside the model context, allowing agents to programmatically reduce large filings before analysis, saving tokens and enabling efficient queries against filings of any size.

The skill includes detailed field mappings for common form types and schedules, helping agents accurately interpret campaign finance data like contributions, disbursements, and committee information.

## Features

- Fetch and analyze FEC filings by filing ID
- Search for committees and filings via the FEC API
- Support for major form types (F1, F2, F3, F99)
- Detailed field mappings for contributions, disbursements, and schedules
- Auto-installing dependencies via uv

## Requirements

- An agent runtime that supports Agent Skills (e.g., [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/))
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (This skill uses `uv` to manage its own dependencies in isolation)
- An [FEC API key](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/) (optional, for committee/filing search)
- Python 3.9+

## Installation (Global)

Clone the repository to a permanent location and symlink the skill into your runtime's skills directory.

```bash
git clone --branch latest git@github.com:hodgesmr/agent-fecfile.git ~/agent-fecfile
```

**Symlink to your agent's skills directory:**
```bash
# Claude Code CLI
ln -sfn ~/agent-fecfile/skills/fecfile ~/.claude/skills/fecfile

# Codex CLI
ln -sfn ~/agent-fecfile/skills/fecfile ~/.codex/skills/fecfile
```

Replace the target path with your agent runtime's skill directory as needed.

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/agent-fecfile && git fetch --tags --force && git checkout latest
```

Or pin a specific version:
```bash
cd ~/agent-fecfile && git fetch && git checkout 1.0.0
```

## Usage

Once installed, ask your agent to analyze FEC filings.

> [!TIP]
> For best results, use the most capable models available in your agent runtime (e.g., Claude Opus 4.5 or comparable frontier models). More capable models produce better analysis and more accurate field interpretations.

### Basic Usage (With A Filing ID)

If you already have an FEC filing ID, you can work with it directly, without needing an API key:

```text
❯ What are the largest expenditures in filing 1896830?
```

```text
⏺ FEC Filing 1896830 - Largest Expenditures

  | #   | Recipient                  |    Amount | Date       | Purpose          |
  |-----|----------------------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
  | 1   | Trump National Doral Hotel | $1,013.61 | 2025-05-19 | RNC training     |
  | 2   | Uber.com                   |    $19.77 | 2025-05-06 | Travel - Cabfare |
  |     | TOTAL (itemized)           | $1,033.38 |            |                  |

  Note

  Only 2 expenditures are itemized on Schedule B. The filing shows $21,283.49 in total
  disbursements, meaning most spending (~$20,250) was below the $200 itemization
  threshold and appears only in summary totals.

  The largest single itemized expense was for RNC training at Trump National Doral Hotel
  in May 2025.

```text

```

```text
⏺ FEC Filing 1896830 - Contributions by State

  | State | Count |      Total | % of Total |
  |-------|-------|------------|------------|
  | UT    |    32 | $35,042.25 |      87.0% |
  | VA    |     2 |  $2,400.00 |       6.0% |
  | GA    |     1 |    $750.00 |       1.9% |
  | MI    |     1 |    $750.00 |       1.9% |
  | MD    |     2 |    $750.00 |       1.9% |
  | FL    |     1 |    $600.00 |       1.5% |
  | TOTAL |    39 | $40,292.25 |       100% |

  Utah dominates with 87% of the total contributions. The committee received from
  6 states total, with only 7 out-of-state contributions.
```

### FEC API Setup (Optional)

The skill includes `fec_api.py` for searching committees and filings via the authenticated FEC API.

#### 1. Get an API Key

1. Visit https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/
2. Go to "Sign up for an API key" and fill out the form
3. You'll receive your API key via email

#### 2. Store Your API Key

To shield the key from LLM model consumption, the skill looks for the API key in your system keyring. The script uses the Python [keyring](https://pypi.org/project/keyring/) library, which supports a variety of operating system keyrings.

If on macOS:

1. Open Keychain Access (Applications → Utilities → Keychain Access)
2. Click File → New Password Item (or press ⌘N)
3. Fill in:
   - Keychain Item Name: `fec-api`
   - Account Name: `api-key`
   - Password: *your API key*
4. Click Add

When the script attempts to unlock Keychain, macOS will prompt you to allow access.

For other supported systems, consult the [keyring documentation](https://keyring.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

> [!CAUTION]
> The user experience of macOS Keychain is [not great](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/644) and will likely result in many repeated password prompts. This may tempt the user to "Always Allow" access to the key by Python. Doing so can expose the key to the LLM agent if it then tries to write Python to read the key itself. Other system keyrings may have a better user experience.

### Searching For Committees and Filings

Once your API key is stored, queries become more powerful. You can use the agent skill to search for committees and filings for you.

## Security Notes

- **Network access**: This skill requires network access to fetch data from the FEC (`docquery.fec.gov`). It will not work in environments where external network access is restricted.
- **Untrusted content**: FEC filings should be considered [untrusted content](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/). A malicious campaign sneaking prompt injections into the memo text field of their F99 is probably unlikely, but not impossible.
- **Keyring access**: Even though the API key is securely stored in the system keyring, the agent may still attempt to access it by writing bespoke scripts. Always monitor the agent's attempted actions before unlocking access to the secret store.
